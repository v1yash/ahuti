🔧 Usage Instructions
Clone or download the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/aahuti-homepage.git
Ensure all image files like h1.png, bus.png, ce.png, etc. are in the same directory.

Make sure header.css is in the root directory or update the <link> tag path accordingly.

Open index.html in a browser to view the homepage.

For PHP forms (Contact.php, login.php), run using XAMPP, WAMP, or Live Server + PHP extension.

⚠️ Notes
Ensure correct image file names and paths for the slider to function properly.

localhost URLs (Contact.php, login.php) will only work if you’re running a local PHP server.

You can link to actual URLs if you plan to deploy online.
